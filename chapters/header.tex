\chapter*{Abstract}

This is an abstract. I am formalizing Coq modules in MetaCoq, it is a missing
piece of the already established MetaCoq project. In the second part, as a
requirement for the mathematics requirement, I study some basic properties of
lambda calculus, hopefully culminating in the decidability for conversion in
real-world type systems such as the Martin-Lof Type Theory (MLTT).

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wouldn't come this far with the help of many people along the way. I would
like to thank especially Nicolas Tabareau for having me in Nantes for the summer
of 2022, which changed my life. Thank you professors Yang Yue and Martin Henz of
the National University of Singapore for being my advisors for this project,
even though it a rare one --- externally proposed, cross-faculty, joint final
year project.

I would also like to thank the people who inadvertently made this possible ---
Thomas Tan Chee Kun who gave me a foray into the field of Type Theory, then
Rodolphe Lepigre who was an amazing mentor landing me into a summer of internship.
Not forgetting the valuable friendship and advice I received in Gallinette team,
for the people whom I interacted with: Pierre, Tomas, Yann, Arthur, Iwan, Kenji,
Meven, Assia, Pierre-Marie, Hamza, Enzo, Yannick and everyone else that appeared
during my stay in Gallinette. I truly loved the time there and can't wait to be
back again.
