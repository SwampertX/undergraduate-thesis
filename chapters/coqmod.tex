\chapter{The Module System in Coq}
Coq modules are not first class objects of the language. In fact, it is closer
to a dictionary that stores each entries of a path into a canonical name, which
is then refered to, or compared with when needed. 

How do functors work? They are stored as-is in the global environment. Functor 
applications are evaluated applicatively/generatively.
