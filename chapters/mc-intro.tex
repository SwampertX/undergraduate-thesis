\chapter{Introduction to the MetaCoq Project}
MetaCoq is a project to formalize the core calculus, PCUIC, in Coq, and become
a platform to write tools that can manipulate Coq terms. The effort was complete
for a large part of the core language of Coq, with a few missing pieces:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Eta 
    \item Template Polymorphism
    \item SProps
    \item Modules
\end{itemize}

I will be tackling the last.
