# Yee Jian's Undergraduate Thesis

My thesis topic is "Formalizing Coq Modules in the MetaCoq Project".

You can find my compiled PDFs of the [final report](https://github.com/SwampertX/undergraduate-thesis/releases/download/v1.0.0/XFC4101.Final.Report.pdf)
and [presentation slides](https://github.com/SwampertX/undergraduate-thesis/releases/download/v1.0.0/XFC4101.Final.ReporPresentation.pdf)
in the [releases](https://github.com/SwampertX/undergraduate-thesis/releases/latest) page.

The source files for the final report and presentation slides are in `final-report-new`, and `final-report-new/presentation` respectively.
To compile them locally, run

```bash
xelatex --shell-escape
biber
xelatex --shell-escape
xelatex --shell-escape
```

Enjoy!
