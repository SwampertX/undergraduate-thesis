%%% ABSTRACT %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
  The MetaCoq project provides a verified implementation of a huge subset of
  Coq, however, does not include several features, such as Modules. This project
  aims to formalize and implement a subset of non-parametrized modules in the
  MetaCoq project and show that this implementation enjoys nice type-theoretic
  properties such as confluence, and principal typing. This project provides two
  different approaches to formalizing modules and global environments in Coq,
  and summarizes some proof-theoretic skills that are useful in constructing
  formal proofs.
