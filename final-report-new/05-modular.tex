\chapter{A Modular Environment}

After the completion of my implementation in the previous chapter, the process
of verification the only remaining part, the TemplateCoq to PCUIC translation
proved to be time consuming, resulting me in spending weeks without writing any
\verb|QED|s. This is because in the process of verifying those properties, I
faced many technical challenges in constructing their proofs. Fortunately, two
beneficial events ensued:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item After identifying the pain points in the proofs, I found out the
  decision that led to this situation and in tackling it, gave rise to this more
  natural solution which requires a complete rewrite. Although incomplete, I
  have designed this rewrite and implemented a part of it as far as writing out
  the environment typing rules. I will discuss this implementation in the firs
  section.
  \item In the process of rewrite, due to the design choices and its complexity,
  some non-trivial proof machineries such as nested mutual inductive types with
  their induction hypotheses, well-founded recursion, strengthening induction
  hypothesis were required. Since a number of them are direct consequence of
  this modular environment rewrite, I will include them as a section at the end
  of this chapter as a summary.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Difficulties on the Global Declaration List}

The proof for (TODO: link \verb|trans_lookup_env|) proved to be tedious due to
the double fold. In each fold, one adds definitions to the environment using an
(rightfully) opaque \verb|add_global_decl| function, which changes the
accumulator $\Sigma$ during each fold. A nested fold makes this even more
tedious with proof levels going up to four or five levels.

\pcuic{238}{243}{TemplateToPCUICCorrectness.v}
...
\pcuic{307}{309}{TemplateToPCUICCorrectness.v}
...
\pcuic{316}{319}{TemplateToPCUICCorrectness.v}
...
\pcuic{326}{328}{TemplateToPCUICCorrectness.v}

After spending weeks trying different methods to make this work, including an
elaborate argument defining a strict partial order on kernames (such as the
result used on line 319), I decided to venture for a new solution. The
source of the problem here is the double-fold, which obscures the meaning of
expressions after repeated applications of \verb|add_global_decl| changing the
accumulator environment. To break down the two folds:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The first fold is done over the \emph{list} of global declarations,
  while
  \item the second fold is done over the \emph{module} structure.
\end{itemize}

and the definition for structure fields is identical to that of global
declarations: 

\tc{324}{328}{Environment.v}
\tc{347}{351}{Environment.v}

it is thus natural to link both of them together.

\section{The Modular Environment}
\newcommand{\tcc}[3]{\inputminted[firstline={#1},lastline={#2},linenos]{Coq}{
  code/v2/template-coq/theories/#3}}
\newcommand{\pcuicc}[3]{\inputminted[firstline={#1},lastline={#2},linenos]{Coq}{
  code/v2/pcuic/theories/#3}}

It would be beneficial to unify these two with the same structure: modules. The
list of global declarations itself can be seen as an anonymous, ambient,
top-level module, thus just a special case of a module. Under this
generalization, any well-formedness properties or well-typedness properties
about environments should be subsumed under that of modules, and thus giving us
a good sense in defining the typing rules for modules.

Let us begin by defining modules, then specialize into global declarations:

\tcc{325}{336}{Environment.v}

Structure field now subsumes global declaration, and we note that structure body
is just a convenient name for the list of structure fields indexed by its name -
an identifier. The possible nested structure body inside structure fields are
what gives the tree structure of modules.

\tcc{405}{408}{Environment.v}

Similarly, we define module types to be structure bodies, and a module to be a
module type with an implementation. Since global environments are anonymous
modules, they do not have a possibility of reuse and thus signature is
insignificant here - it is of the same structure of a structure body.




\section{Tactics and Proof Machineries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item nested induction, mutual induction, (can always reduce to the case of a
  simple inductive type, but...)
  \item well-founded recursion and measures.
  \item definition of a strict partial order and strengthening of induction
  hypotheses 
  \item tactics, reflection, proof management.
\end{itemize}
